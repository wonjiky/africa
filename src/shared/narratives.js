However, one important condition for the formation of Onitsha has been the very high rural density in the periphery and surrounding areas. This mostly scattered and linear settlement, whose expansion was constrained (naturally and/or politically), has, due to the underlying demographic pressure, become so dense as to be considered urban. The vast agglomeration of 2 900 km2 has multiple high-density centres linked by large areas with lower population densities whose urban character and form are not fully perceptible. However, the average density of the urban area reaches 3 000 inhabitants per km2, similar to urban areas in Western Europe.",

				  "text1": "There is no universal or generally accepted definition of cities or urban agglomerations. The word city (The notion of “urban” is often conflated with meaning “city” and) mostly refers to a politico-administrative unit whose boundaries and legal status are defined by national governments according to varying administrative, political and/or functional criteria, contexts and objectives. These definitions vary from country to country and in some cases over time within the same country. These differences are also mirrored in the data collected (and reproduced in international comparisons). The heterogeneity of the data provided by national statistics presents a problem for comparing and analysing urbanisation across countries, a problem already identified in 1929 Encyclopedia Britannica; “The census returns of most countries classify the population into urban and rural, but while these figures are useful for comparing changes in the same country between two dates, they are of little use when comparing two countries. This is so because the classification is based upon very different methods in different countries.”. Most definitions are based on administrative, numerical and functional criteria or a combination of those. In Africa, the most widely used criteria is administrative (25 countries), followed by mixed (15 countries) and numerical (13 countries, ranging from 1 500 to 20 000 inhabitants).",

The spatial approach stands in stark contrast to the use of national planning documents or statistics in determining the extent of urbanization, the latter relying strongly on the political recognition of cities as administrative and legal units. However, what counts as a “city” is country-specific and may even change over time, making comparisons between countries difficult. The concept of city is in fact a political construct where the boundaries of the city are determined centrally, whereas Africapolis considers the material reality on the ground, thereby highlighting that the boundaries of agglomerations are, in fact, dynamic and fluid. Africapolis defines as urban any agglomeration that includes more than 10,000 inhabitants. By using the lower threshold of 10,000 inhabitants, Africapolis shows that smaller agglomerations make up an important part of urban settlements in Africa. Compared to the World Urbanization Prospects (WUP) database, which only takes into account agglomerations with more than 300,000 inhabitants, Africapolis reveals 25 times as many urban agglomerations – a total of around 7,400. From a methodological perspective, this approach allows us to make comparisons within and between countries and regions much more easily. "

    //       "storyText_en": "By focusing on agglomerations rather than cities, Africapolis reveals trends that challenge some of the common perceptions about urbanization, such as the concept of rural exodus as a driver of urbanization. Taking the specific example of Onitsha in Nigeria, Africapolis data shows that the idea of rural immigration driving the growth of agglomerations is inadequate in explaining the emergence of Onitsha, which today represents one of the largest urban agglomerations in West Africa. The town of Ontisha itself, is located in the North-Western corner of the agglomeration and has been recognized as a market town since the 1950s. It is made up of three different local government authorities (LGAs), one of which is Onitsha proper, and counts 176,000 inhabitants on an area of just 28 km2. By contrast, the agglomeration of Onitsha had a population of 8.5 million people in 2015, spread out on an area 100 times as large as Ontisha itself and with a density just short of 3000 inhabitants per km2. Onitsha today ranks as the second largest agglomeration in Nigeria behind Lagos. It is expected to reach a population of 25 million by 2050 and could eventually merge with Aba, Uyo and Port Harcourt, forming a much larger agglomeration that would outstrip Lagos and Kano in both size and population. Despite its size and the potential policy and planning implications this involves, Ontisha does not figure anywhere in the literature or in planning, policy and statistical analyses. Besides Onitsha, Africa is home to several such large spontaneous agglomerations that Africapolis refers to as “unidentified geographical objects” since their urban character and morphology are not recognized by the national institutions. The spatial dimension is crucial in understanding how these agglomerations came into existence. Onitsha, for instance, has not grown through the influx of rural populations but instead is an example of in-situ urbanization: the agglomeration has grown organically through the increasing population density in existing settlements that have grown and merged into one bigger agglomeration once the density has reached a certain critical mass. Not only do these spontaneous agglomerations not result from an influx of rural populations, they emerge in fact from the opposite: the absence of emigration from rural areas, which fuels the increasing population density that eventually leads to the fusion of multiple settlements into a bigger whole.

    //       "storyText_en": "To understand modern urbanization in Africa, one has to examine the characteristics of the large agglomerations such as the ones in Nigeria’s South-East. Unlike a traditional city, the Onitsha agglomeration has no city center. Instead, it has multiple centers that each engage in their own economic activity, including industry, manufacturing and crafts. Some of the agglomerations of Nigeria are very strongly connected to the global market, not least because the Niger delta is a key production area for natural gas and petroleum. The agglomeration of Aba, wedged between the Ontisha and Uyo agglomerations, is known for its multiple industrial zones that produce anything from textiles to plastics, cosmetics, pharmaceutical products and palm oil. The Ariaria Market is now the largest markets in West Africa, exporting textiles and shoes into the wider world. Finding a proper definition for these agglomerations is not an easy task: they could be qualified as “conurbations” since they do not have one, but multiple centers and agricultural activities tend to co-exist alongside industrial ones. However, the traditional definition of conurbations – which was popularized during the early 20th century to describe the hastily emerging cities built on industrial activity - implies a movement of rural populations towards these industrial areas, which is not the case for Onitsha, Uyo, Aba and Nsukka in Nigeria. Instead, some of these areas are in fact marked by a strong outward flow of people. This is particularly true of Nigeria’s Ibo people that are increasingly migrating towards other areas in the country and outside. Unlike the modern melting pots of the developed world, the agglomerations of South-Eastern Nigeria experience a reduction of social and ethnic diversity as a result of emigration. Ethno-linguistic factors could also explain why, despite their economic weight, the agglomerations of Nigeria’s Niger delta go politically unrecognized. The two main cities of the country, Lagos and Kano, are strongly related to two ethno-linguistic groups: the Yoruba and Haussa respectively. There may be some reluctance in acknowledging the existence of a third center of power controlled predominantly by the Ibo."

These categories are highly political and therefore inadequate descriptors of the urban reality of modern-day Africa. The focus on larger cities has also resulted in skewing the perception of African urbanization. If we are to better understand and predict future trends in urbanization, it is important to take into account the smaller agglomerations, which – as the case of South-Eastern Nigeria has shown – are likely to predict the emergence of future agglomerations through the fusion of several smaller agglomerations into one. This is particularly true of the African highlands, where population densities are high and the space is limited by political and natural boundaries. For researchers, social scientists and policy-makers, the Africapolis methodology – with its focus on the spatial dimension – could provide important new insight to better manage and predict the growth of Africa’s urban agglomerations. In-situ urbanization is likely to be the biggest factor in the increasing level of urbanization that the continent will see in the next few decades. Only if this trend is properly understood, can policy-makers, urban planners and local governments make adequate decisions about the provision of basic infrastructure and services, and harness the economic potential that emerges from these vibrant places."
