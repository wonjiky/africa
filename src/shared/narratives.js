This form of emergence of urban agglomerations is more common in regions where settlements are clustered, for instance in dry and savannah climates. Yet, regions with dispersed or scattered settlements produce different forms of urbanisation. In dispersed rural settlement areas, populations are located more linearly with respect to some physical or cultural landscapes, e.g. rivers, valleys, roads. Here, population growth leads to a linear extension of settlements that merge and absorp initially separated rural settlements resulting in the formation of one continuously built-up area with a combined population of more than 10 000 inhabitants.

						"text": "Africapolis data is based on a large inventory of housing and population censuses, electoral registers and other official population sources, in some cases dating back to the beginning of the 20th century. The regularity, the detail and the reliability of these sources vary from country to country, and from period to period. Satellite and aerial images are used to inform on the physical evidence on the ground, that is the built-up area and the precise location of settlements. Other official cartographic resources, such as administrative boundaries, are used to link population data to the observed information on the built-up areas.",

						"text": "Africapolis, like e-Geopolis globally, has been designed to provide a much needed standardised and geospatial database on urbanisation dynamics in Africa, with the aim of making urban data in Africa comparable across countries and across time. This version of Africapolis is the first time that the data for the 50 countries currently covered are available for the same base year – 2015. In addition, Africapolis closes one major data gap by integrating 7 225 small towns and intermediary cities between 10 000 and 300 000 inhabitants (6 737 urban agglomerations between 10 000 and 100 000 inhabitants for a total of 180 million people).",

We will keep looking for new ways, new tools and new data to improve Africapolis and its relevance for the African continent and invite you to contribute.",
